# F1 Livery Style Rules (Design Language)

This design must follow modern Formula 1 livery principles.
The goal is a functional, high-performance motorsport look — not a decorative illustration.

---

## Core Philosophy

Formula 1 liveries are designed for:
- Speed
- Brand clarity at high velocity
- Visual balance across complex body panels

This is NOT:
- A poster
- A wallpaper
- A symmetric graphic design exercise

---

## Primary Color Blocking

- Use large, confident color blocks.
- Avoid small scattered elements.
- Each major body area should have a clear dominant color.

Rules:
- Front hood + bumper: strong central visual mass
- Side panels: elongated shapes emphasizing forward motion
- Rear: simpler and less crowded than front

---

## Directional Flow (Very Important)

All graphics must visually move FORWARD.

Acceptable:
- Forward-leaning stripes
- Angled cuts pointing toward the front
- Gradients that compress toward the front

Unacceptable:
- Vertical-only layouts
- Random diagonal angles
- Designs that pull the eye backward

---

## Logo Hierarchy

Formula 1 liveries use strict logo hierarchy.

1. Primary Logo
   - One dominant brand
   - Placed on the most visible area
   - Never repeated excessively

2. Secondary Logos
   - Smaller
   - Used to support, not compete
   - Positioned on side panels or secondary zones

3. Tertiary / Pattern Use
   - Only as texture
   - Never full-size repeated logos

Never treat logos as wallpaper patterns.

---

## Logo Placement Rules

- Logos must sit on visually stable surfaces.
- Avoid sharp edges, folds, or cut lines.
- Logos must never be split across panels.

Front:
- One strong, centered or slightly elevated logo

Sides:
- Logos stretched horizontally
- Readable at speed from trackside angles

Rear:
- Minimal branding
- Clear and uncluttered

---

## Symmetry Rules

- Overall design balance may be symmetric.
- Text and logos must NOT be mirrored for symmetry.
- Left and right sides must be independently readable.

Visual balance > geometric symmetry.

---

## Use of Negative Space

Negative space is intentional.

Rules:
- Leave breathing room around major logos
- Do not fill every available area
- Empty areas increase perceived speed

If an area does not need branding, leave it clean.

---

## Color Contrast

- High contrast between logo and base color
- Avoid low-contrast overlays
- Readability at distance is mandatory

If a logo cannot be identified at speed, the design fails.

---

## F1 Authenticity Check

Before finalizing, confirm:

- Does this look believable on a real F1 car?
- Could this survive at 300 km/h visually?
- Is the design still clear in a quick glance?

If it feels like a poster or wallpaper, it is incorrect.
